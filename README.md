# RChain bounties network mobile app

## Description
A React Native cross-platform mobile app for exploring bounties. Uses the [RChain bounties API](https://github.com/th3build/rchain-bounties-api) and the [Github REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/?) for data.

## Project status

This project is divided in 2 stages:

1. Read only app meant for exploring the bounties.
2. Read and write app that is meant for exploring and interacting with bounties.

As of this moment in time the first stage is being developed. The development on the second stage will start once [the API](https://github.com/th3build/rchain-bounties-api) is completed.
